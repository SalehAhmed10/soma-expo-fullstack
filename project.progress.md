Project: soma

Overall Progress: The soma-mobile-auth project is a mobile application built with Expo (React Native) and TypeScript. It appears to be significantly developed, with a strong focus on user authentication, content delivery (likely audio-focused, given "soma" and audio permissions/plugins), and user-specific features. The core application structure, navigation, and many key features are in place. The current project.todo.md suggests that the next major phase will be focused on performance optimization and potentially refining existing functionalities.

Key Milestones Achieved:

Project Setup & Foundation:

Expo project initialized and configured (app.json), utilizing the new architecture (newArchEnabled: true).
TypeScript is used throughout the project.
Routing is handled by expo-router, with distinct route groups for onboarding, main app tabs, and other app screens.
Styling likely uses Tailwind CSS / NativeWind (inferred from tailwind.config.js, index.css).
A structured project layout is established (assets, components, constants, store, utils).
Version control with Git is in use, with a .gitignore file configured to exclude build artifacts and local environment files.
Onboarding & Authentication:

A comprehensive onboarding flow is present (app/(onboarding)/).
User authentication is a core feature, with screens for:
Auth Home (likely offering multiple login methods like Apple, Google, Facebook, Email, based on previous interactions).
Account Creation.
Login.
Authentication state is managed, likely using Zustand (store/authStore.ts).
Main Application Features (Tab-Based Navigation):

Home: A dedicated home screen exists.
Sessions:
Browsing sessions, including categorized and sub-categorized views.
Session detail view and a session player.
Session search functionality.
My Mat:
Features related to a "mat," including adding, listing, and a "sound level" feature.
Playlists:
Creating and viewing playlists.
Managing tracks within playlists.
Profile:
User account management (viewing details, logout).
Subscription management (overview and details).
UI & Components:

A library of custom UI components has been developed (components/), including CustomText, CategoryGrid, SwipeCarousel, buttons, and skeleton loaders.
The app utilizes vector icons.
Native Functionality:

Audio: The app is configured for audio playback, including background audio and microphone access for recording.
Video: Supports video playback, picture-in-picture, and background playback.
Splash screen is configured.
State Management & Utilities:

Zustand is used for global state management (store/authStore.ts, store/contentStore.ts).
Utility functions for API calls, date formatting, etc., are in place.
Next Steps (Inferred from project.todo.md and README.md): The primary focus for future work, as documented, is on optimization:

Server-side Image Processing: Generating optimized thumbnails and responsive images.
Lazy Loading & Code Splitting: For performance improvements, especially in lists like playlists.
Network Layer Optimization: Implementing caching and stale-while-revalidate patterns.
Device Storage Management: Periodically clearing image cache.
Performance Monitoring: Adding metrics and using debugging tools.
This indicates that the functional aspects of the application are largely complete, and the project is moving towards enhancing performance, efficiency, and maintainability.

I will now write this summary to your project.progress.md file.

Okay, I will read the codebase to give you a comprehensive summary of the project's progress. This might take a few moments.

Read package.json, lines 1 to 65

Okay, I've reviewed the codebase. Here's a summary of the project progress for soma-mobile-auth:

Project: soma-mobile-auth (React Native Expo App)

Core Functionality:

Authentication:
User registration (CreateAccount.tsx) and login (login.tsx) are implemented, interacting with a backend API (api.ts configured to https://soma-nextjs.vercel.app/api/somamobileapis).
Authentication state is managed using Zustand (authStore.ts) and tokens are stored using @react-native-async-storage/async-storage.
Social login buttons (Apple, Google, Facebook, Email) are present in AuthHome.tsx, though the actual social login logic might be pending full implementation beyond console logs.
Password reset functionality seems to be commented out or not yet implemented.
Onboarding:
An onboarding flow exists under (onboarding), including an initial screen (index.tsx) and the authentication screens.
A "What's on your mind" screen (whatsonyourmind.tsx) appears to be part of this flow, possibly for initial user preferences.
Main Application (Tabs Layout):
A tab-based navigation (_layout.tsx) is in place for authenticated users, including sections for Home, My Mat, Playlists, Sessions, and Profile.
The root layout (_layout.tsx) handles routing logic, directing users to onboarding or the main app based on authentication status. It also loads custom fonts.
Content & Features (within (appscreen)):
Profile Management (account.tsx): Displays user information (full name, email). Placeholder functions for "EDIT", "MANAGE", "DELETE", and "Logout" have been added.
Sessions ([id].tsx, session/search.tsx, etc.):
Detailed session view ([id].tsx) fetches session data from the API, displaying title, description, duration, start time, instructor, and type (Live/Pre-recorded).
Includes functionality to start/join sessions (currently with placeholder alerts or routing to a video player).
UI elements for loading states, error handling, and a "Go Back" button are present.
Image display with placeholders if actual images are missing.
My Mat (mymat/addmat.tsx, mats.tsx, soundlevel.tsx): Files exist, suggesting features related to user's personal "mat" or space, possibly including adding items and sound level adjustments.
Playlists ([id].tsx, new.tsx): Structure for playlist creation and viewing.
Subscription (subscription/index.tsx, subscriptiondetail.tsx): Files suggest subscription management features.
Test API (testapi/userprofile.tsx): Likely for testing API integrations.
Test Tracks (testtracks/trackplayer.tsx): Suggests a track player feature.
UI and UX:

Styling: Uses NativeWind for Tailwind CSS-like styling, evident in class names throughout the components.
Custom Components:
CustomText, CustomButton, SocialButton for consistent UI.
CategoryGrid, SwipeCarousel for displaying content.
SkeletonLoaders for loading states.
IconSymbol, TabBarBackground for UI enhancements.
Layout & Navigation:
Expo Router is used for file-system based routing.
SafeAreaView is implemented in _layout.tsx for handling notches and system UI.
Status bar is configured (style="dark", translucent={true}).
Assets: Includes images (logos, icons, placeholders, gifs), fonts, and sample audio.
Technical Aspects:

Dependencies:
Key libraries include expo, react, react-native, expo-router, axios (for API calls), zustand (state management), nativewind (styling), @react-native-async-storage/async-storage.
Specific Expo modules like expo-audio, expo-video, expo-font, expo-splash-screen, expo-status-bar are used.
react-native-reanimated version was updated to ~3.17.5 to resolve build issues.
API Integration:
A centralized API utility (api.ts) is used for making requests, including an interceptor to attach auth tokens.
Build & Configuration:
app.json contains project configuration for Expo, including name, version, orientation, icons, splash screen, permissions (audio recording), and plugins.
Android specific configurations like edgeToEdgeEnabled are set.
.gitignore is configured to exclude build artifacts and sensitive files.
Error Handling & Logging:
Alert.alert is used for user-facing error messages (e.g., login failures).
console.log and console.error are used for debugging.
Development & Project Management:

Scripts: package.json includes scripts for starting the app, running on Android/iOS/Web, and linting. A reset-project.js script is also present.
Documentation:
README.md and project.todo.md contain notes on additional optimization tasks.
project.progress.md is used to track progress (as updated in our conversation).
Overall Status: The project has a solid foundation with user authentication, a tab-based navigation structure for the main app, and several feature areas stubbed out or partially implemented (sessions, profile, potentially "my mat" and playlists). API integration for core auth and session data is functional. UI is styled with NativeWind, and custom components promote consistency. Recent work focused on resolving build errors, standardizing API calls, and refining UI/UX aspects like safe areas and status bar.

Pending/Areas for Further Development (based on codebase structure and previous conversation):

Full implementation of features within (appscreen) like "My Mat", "Playlists", "Subscription".
Completing the functionality for "EDIT", "MANAGE", "DELETE" in the profile section.
Implementing actual social login logic beyond placeholders.
Implementing features mentioned in project.todo.md (server-side image processing, lazy loading, API caching, etc.).
Further testing and refinement of all features.
The "show system navigation on swipe up" feature using expo-navigation-bar was reverted and is not currently implemented.
This summary is based on the file structure, content of key files like package.json, app.json, routing files (_layout.tsx), authentication screens, and the session detail screen.
