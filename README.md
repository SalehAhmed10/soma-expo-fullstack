5. Additional Optimization Tips
Server-side Image Processing:

Talk to your backend team about generating optimized thumbnails (around 200KB max)
Consider using responsive images with srcSet equivalents for different screen sizes
Lazy Loading and Code Splitting:

Only load playlists when a user scrolls to that section
Consider adding pagination to lists with many items
Network Layer Optimization:

Add caching to your API requests
Implement a stale-while-revalidate pattern for content
Device Storage Management:

Clear image cache periodically using expo-file-system
Track cache size and implement user controls for clearing it
Performance Monitoring:

Add metrics to track load times and interactions
Consider using Flipper or other performance tools for debugging
These changes will make your app significantly more performant and maintainable while reducing the bandwidth usage for your users.
